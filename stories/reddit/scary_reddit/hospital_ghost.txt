"I worked at a very small hospital, maybe 30 beds, that has been around for MANY years. In the basement is, of course, the old morgue, and there is one elevator that goes from the basement to the main floor outside the nurses' station. This elevator would randomly come up in the middle of the night, and the doors would open, prompting all the staff to get up to find the patient who had just passed away.

One night, my coworkers and I were sitting at the nurses' station when down the short hall to our right, we heard a TV come on, the volume turned up as loud as it could go. One of my coworkers and I walked down that hall to find the TV and turn it down. There is one room down that hall that maintenance has closed with "Do Not Enter" signs on the door. After looking in all the open rooms with no other room to check, we opened the door. There was NOTHING in this room except the TV. I walked in, turned off the TV, and said, "Stop that. There is a sick baby next door who needs to sleep, so please be quiet." I walked out and closed the door, with no further incidents involving the TV."
