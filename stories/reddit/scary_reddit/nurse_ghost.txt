As an EMT, I'm always fascinated by the unexplained. While I wouldn't consider myself particularly religious, I've encountered things that defy rational explanation. One memory stands out vividly.

It was 3 am, and I found myself in the hospital basement retrieving a new gurney to replace one that had been damaged by a violent patient. The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) on the third floor was locked down for the night, with no visitors allowed in the hospital. The basement storage unit was cluttered with equipment, so when I felt my shirt being tugged, I assumed it had caught on something. But then it happened again, and this time, I heard a little girl's voice, clear as a bell, saying, 'I'm lost.' My heart raced, every hair on my body stood on end, and I immediately called my partner down, feigning a need for assistance with the gurney.

I've since spoken with nurses, CNAs, and even some physicians who have shared similar eerie experiences, particularly in the ICU and hospice wards.
