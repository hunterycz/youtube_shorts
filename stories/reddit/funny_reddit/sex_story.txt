My friend was sleeping over at my house. My parents and brother were all sleeping upstairs while we were downstairs watching TV, playing video games, and hanging out. Around 1 am, he asks if this girl can come over. He REALLY wants to hang out with her, and I don't want to turn him down, so I reluctantly agree, on the condition that she's quiet.

The three of us are hanging out, and I make some excuse to leave the room so my friend can have some alone time with this girl. I'm upstairs in my room when I start hearing some loud noises from downstairs. This is bad news for me because it's late, and my parents are sleeping, but it's great news for my friend since he's finally getting to spend time with this girl he really likes.

I hear stirring in the next room, and I know that the noise has woken my parents. The last thing I want is for my confused father to walk in on my friend hanging out with this girl in the basement. What do I do? I quickly go to a website, find a video with some loud noises, crank that up to 100 on my speakers, and let it play for the few minutes that they needed.

My dad ended up coming into my room, discovering the source of the noise, and awkwardly leaving. My buddy ended up having "the best time ever, bro," but, man, there were some awkward glances exchanged between my parents and me the next morning.
